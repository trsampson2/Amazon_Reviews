# Amazon Reviews

## Overview

What do the reviews say?  Are they useful?  This analysis picks one dataset from the Amazon reviews and looks at the total dataset and looks at if it is a paid or unpaid review.  It looks at if it actually makes a difference if the review is paid (Vine) or unpaid. It is based on how many people gavea 5 star reivew for the subject of the dataset. The analysis looks at the reviews for shoes.

## Results

There were a total of 22 paid reviews through the Vine program and 13 of those reviews were 5 star ratings.  That is 59% of all paid reviews.

There were a total of 26987 unpaid reviews that were given.  There were 14,475 5-star unpaid reviews.  That is 54% of all unpaid reviews. 

## Summary

I would say that there isn't a bias for 5-star reviews when the review is paid for in the Vine program.  The percentage of paid and unpaid is about the same with this analysis.  I think there could also be a deeper analysis on the actual shoe and looking at the ratings that were given.
